THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
I can choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN I answer the prompts and then click the generate password button
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated, the password is written to the page.
